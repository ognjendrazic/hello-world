Project: Hello World
Hello and welcome to my first GitHub repository, the main function of this repository is to introduce myself to the world of GitHub and programming. 
I am a student at the University of Agder in Norway, currently on my first year as a computer/data engineer.
Primarily we are focusing on learning C, C# and C++.

Let me end this with a simple Hello!
